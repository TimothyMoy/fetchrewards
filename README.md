Fetch Reward Coding Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to write a web app that retrieve data from a json file.

The web app should do the following task:

Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.
The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

For this project I mainly used React.
